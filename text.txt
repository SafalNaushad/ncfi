To update an array of objects in Angular and add a new array of objects to it while also removing any old array elements with the same ID, you can use the spread operator to create a new array with the updated elements, and then use the Array.prototype.filter() method to remove any elements with the same ID as the new elements.

Here is an example of how you could do this:


let originalArray = [{id: 1, name: "item1"}, {id: 2, name: "item2"}];
let newArray = [{id: 3, name: "item3"}, {id: 4, name: "item4"}];
let updatedArray = [...originalArray, ...newArray].filter(item => !originalArray.find(original => original.id === item.id));
console.log(updatedArray);


This will create a new array that includes all of the elements from the original array and the new array, and then use the filter method to remove any duplicates based on the id.

In Angular, you can use the spread operator and the Array.prototype.filter() method in a similar way as in plain JavaScript to update an array of objects and add a new array of objects while also removing any old array elements with the same ID.

Here is an example of how you could do this in an Angular component:


import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  originalArray = [{id: 1, name: "item1"}, {id: 2, name: "item2"}];
  newArray = [{id: 3, name: "item3"}, {id: 4, name: "item4"}];

  updateArray() {
    this.originalArray = [...this.originalArray, ...this.newArray].filter(item => !this.originalArray.find(original => original.id === item.id));
  }
}

In this example, the originalArray and newArray are properties of the component, and the updateArray() method uses the spread operator and the filter method to update the originalArray and remove any duplicates based on the id.
You can then call this method in some event like a button click or ngOnInit()

<button (click)="updateArray()">Update Array</button>


This will create a new array that includes all of the elements from the original array and the new array, and then use the filter method to remove any duplicates based on the id.
